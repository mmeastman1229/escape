# Escape
Escape - A Python Adventure is a game created by Sean McManus. 
Art for the game is by Rafael Pimenta

I encourage you to go to  [Author's Site](https://www.sean.co.uk) and check out the book. It is a code-along project on creating a space game. I went through
the book and made some small tweaks along the way to have it be more like I wanted. This project I am working on is for my practice usinmg a vsc and code refactoring
to come up with a slightly different system then the book originally published. This first stage is to keep it a functional program, but to put the code into different
modules to make it easier to find code and maintain. 

If you have done this book and have any suggestions, please feel free to make pulls and branch changes.
